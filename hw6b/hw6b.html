    <h1>Homework 6b: Census Data Ratios and Categories</h1>
    <h2>The following map highlights the ratio of county females over the age of 18, compared to the county's total female population. The map depicts a Standard Deviation classification. The distribution of the ratio conforms to normal distribution, allowing for accurate variation from the mean ratio.</h2>

    <h2>The following map highlights the ratio between county males to the same county's total population. The ratio is classified by Natural Breaks. This is best suited becuse of high variation from the mean ratio value, compared to other ratios. This creates an uneven, but not highly skewed, distribution.</h2>

    <h2>The folowing map shows the ratio of males under the age of 18 to all males in a county. The map shows an even distribution, enough to be classified by Quantiles. Being equal, there is enough to place these values into equal numbers of observations.</h2>
