    <h1>Homework 8: Geoprocessing Analysis</h1>
    <h2>The following map depicts the question "Does Texas' Wind Turbine industry intersect/affect the state's nationally protected lands?". This is building on the concerns of citizens that wind farms can have impacts on Texas ecosystems. To solve this, I wanted to measure proximity of turbines to protected land boundaries. Two buffers, using the buffer() tool, were established around each turbine. The first buffer measuring at 6000 meters and the second at 10000 meters. Wind turbines only cover part of the state, and to highlight the polygon's shape of turbine distribution, I used the convex hull tool in QGIS. Lands around the southeastern coastline, central plains, and certain areas in western Texas were within the convex hull polygon. Some lands where within both buffer zones of the turbines, showing intersection throughout central Texas.</h2>
